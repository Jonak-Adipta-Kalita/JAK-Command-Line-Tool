The CLI tool is a versatile solution primarily focused on networking and package management for the [JAK-Programming-Language](https://github.com/Jonak-Adipta-Kalita/JAK-Programming-Language). It enables users to configure network settings, monitor activity, and troubleshoot connectivity issues via a command-line interface. Additionally, it streamlines the installation, updating, and removal of language-specific libraries and packages, enhancing productivity for developers and system administrators.
